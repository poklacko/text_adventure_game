# text_adventure_game

The code is for a text adventure game where players explore a forest and make choices that affect the story. 
The game starts when the player types "start," and they can navigate through different steps by selecting options like "hill" or "river." 
Players roll dice to add random elements to the game, which can speed up or slow down their remaining time. 
The game ends with a message that summarizes the player's journey based on how much time they have left.
The game is incomplete because each keyword is missing a description that tells the story for that particular step. For example:
<br>
- 'Start' :
